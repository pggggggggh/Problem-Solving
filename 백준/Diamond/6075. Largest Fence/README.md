### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has purchased N (5 <= N <= 250) fence posts in order to build a very nice-looking fence. Everyone knows the best fences are convex polygons where fence posts form vertices of a polygon. The pasture is represented as a rectilinear grid; fencepost i is at integer coordinates (x_i, y_i) (1 <= x_i <= 1,000; 1 <= y_i <= 1000).</p>

<p>Given the locations of N fence posts (which, intriguingly, feature no set of three points which are collinear), what is the largest number of fence posts FJ can use to create a fence that is convex?</p>

<p>For test cases worth 45% of the points for this problem, N <= 65.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer: N</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes fence post i's location with two space-separated integers: x_i and y_i</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer, the maximum possible number of fence posts that form a convex polygon.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
