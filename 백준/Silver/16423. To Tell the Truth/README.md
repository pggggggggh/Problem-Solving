### 문제 설명

<p>There are n people in a room, each of whom always tells the truth, or always lies. Each of them makes a statement of the form: “Some number between a and b (inclusive) of us are telling the truth.” What is the maximum number of truth-tellers in the room?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.</p>

<p>Each test case will begin with a line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000) which is the number of people in the room.</p>

<p>Each of the next n lines will have two space-separated integers, a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n). Each line represents the statement of one person that “Some number between a and b (inclusive) of us are telling the truth.”</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single integer, which is the largest possible number of truth-tellers, or -1 if the statements are inconsistent.</p>
